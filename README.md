A java application for drawing tangles and knots. 

Java3D is required!

Hold the mouse button while moving the mouse to make the figure move.

     left mouse button       -  rotate
     right mouse button      -  translate

The complete directions and motivation for using this application can be found in [my bachelor's thesis](https://sites.google.com/site/alfaromontufar/tesis.pdf?attredirects=0). An introductory paper on the subject can be found in the Miselanea Matematica: [Knots in biology](http://www.miscelaneamatematica.org/Misc44/Cabrera_h.pdf). A previous project using only Java can be found [here](https://github.com/alfaromontufar/Knot2D).
